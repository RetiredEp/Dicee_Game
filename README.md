# Dicee Game

Welcome to the Dicee Game! This is a simple front-end project that simulates rolling two dice. Each time the page is refreshed, the dice will roll and the game will determine which player wins based on the dice values.

## Project Overview

The Dicee Game consists of:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the game, including the display of dice images and game status.
- **CSS**: Styles the game layout and elements to ensure a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, randomly generating dice values and determining the winner.

## How It Works

1. **Refresh the Page**: Each time the page is refreshed, the dice images will update to reflect new random values.
2. **Determine Winner**: The JavaScript code compares the values of the two dice. The player with the higher dice value wins. If both dice show the same value, itâ€™s a draw.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the game.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the game layout and appearance.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the dice roll logic and updates the game display.

## Code Explanation

- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Defines the layout with two dice images, player labels, and a message indicating the winner.
- **CSS (`style.css`)**: Styles the game elements, including the layout and colors.
- **JavaScript (`index.js`)**: Generates random dice values, updates the dice images, and displays the result (winner or draw).

## Example

When you refresh the page, you might see something like this:

- **Dice Images**: The images representing the rolled dice.
- **Result Message**: "Player 1 WINS", "Player 2 WINS", or "It's a DRAW Roll Again".

Enjoy rolling the dice!
